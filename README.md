# Thank to Shiny
As a data scientists, I was struggling with distributing my work. <br />
Since I have discovered Shiny package in `R`, I have made that problem of the past. <br/>
Now, in this repository, we will go through some projects using Shiny R.<br/>
We will also use reticulate package as we will use `python` in `R`.

<b>This application contains seven (07) projects:</b>
<dl>
  <dt>Project 1 : Play Golf Prediction</dt>
  <dd>This project is a Machine Learning Project that uses Random Forest to predict whether you go out and play Golf or not. <br/> The application gives the probability of the event to occur.  </dd>
  <dt>Project 2 : Vader Sentiment Analysis</dt>
  <dd>This project is a Machine Learning Project that uses Vader Sentiment Analysis model to achieve COVID 19 perception in the African Region. <br/> The application classify an article whether it is negative, positive or neutral.  </dd>
  <dt>Project 3 : WB indicators</dt>
  <dd>This project is to ease the process of seeking indicators on World Bank database<br/> With the application you just provide key words and the all the indicators that contain these key words are brought out.  </dd>
  <dt>Project 4 : World Bank Indicators Metadatas</dt>
  <dd>This project is to ease the process of seeking Metadata of indicators that are on World Bank database<br/> With the application you just provide the appropriate indicator's code and the metadata of this indicator will be brought out.  </dd>
  <dt>Project 5 : WB Indicator Datas</dt>
  <dd>This project is to ease the process of seeking data of indicators that are on World Bank database<br/> With the application you just provide the appropriate indicator's code and the data of this indicator will be brought out.  </dd>
  <dt>Project 6 : GHO indicators</dt>
  <dd>This project is to ease the process of seeking indicators on Global Health Observatory database<br/> With the application you just provide key words and the all the indicators that contain these key words are brought out.  </dd>
  <dt>Project 7 : GHO Indicator Datas</dt>
  <dd>This project is to ease the process of seeking data of indicators that are on Global Health Observatory database<br/> With the application you just provide the appropriate indicator's code and the data of this indicator will be brought out.  </dd>
