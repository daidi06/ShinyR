# Thank to Shiny
As a data scientists, I was struggling with distributing my work. <br />
Since I have discovered Shiny package in R, I have made that problem of the past. <br/>
Now, in this repository, we will go through some projects using Shiny R.<br/>
We will also use reticulate package as we will use python in R.
